# Digital Attendance System (C++)

A console-based application designed to replace paper-based attendance tracking in lecture halls. This project is developed as part of the Mid-Semester Project requirements.

## Project Overview
This system allows for digital management of student records and attendance sessions, ensuring data persistence and reliable reporting.

## Week 1 Progress: Student Management
The following features have been implemented in the first milestone:
- **Student Class:** Defined with attributes for Name and Index Number.
- **Student Registration:** Ability to add new students to the system.
- **View Records:** A list view of all registered students.
- **Search Functionality:** Locate specific students using their unique Index Number.
- **Menu System:** A user-friendly, console-based navigation menu.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (like MinGW for Windows).
2. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o attendance_system
